why cannot we use local storage in nextjs auth?
-get basics cleared
-in nextjs, browser(client) sends an http request to the server(to get back the html file, not a axios type req)
-the server is the mediator, it then sends a req to the database to get the data or whatever
-then it returns an html file with the data
-this is SSR

-now local storage ka access client side ke paas hi hai not server side
-so during ssr, server cannot access it
-the initial req, when a user say goes to check his creds in the website, the initial req sent by the client here cannot have an auth header that can access the local storage
-as then it becomes a CSR, client side req

-so if the server does not get the jwt from the local storage, in the initial render it cannot send back the details
-we could make subsequent requests, but the initial render cannot have the details this way OR teh pre-rendered stuff cannot have this auth header


Why cookies?
upon sigin, the server sets the cookie 
-browsers have a property that once it is set, it will be sent by default in every request.
-so after sigin, if we try to do anything that requires the auth again, like getting some details, then set cookie is already there 


by defualt:
have domains set and samesite to lax or strict to prevent csrf attacks
