//everytime you change/create a schema.prisma file
//you need to migrate and generate clients

//WHAT ARE CLIENTS?
//We can use commands like User.findone or ToDo.create to do CRUD operations
//Clients are the classes created by the command we used in its js code, with all the properties like crud operations
//these are autogenerated by prisma based on our schema file when we ran the command npx prisma generate
