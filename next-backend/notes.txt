12. PRE SERVER ACTIONS
without server actions, we had an api folder(opinionated), uske andar user folder as api/user ki saari routes hongi isme
then uske andar route.ts file jiska code tha ye

//we need to keep all our routes/backend in api folder
//lets say usme ek route is user
//toh our code goes inside a ts file called route.ts
import client from "@/db"
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

//the names are fixed, hence why it is an opinionated framework
export async function POST(req : NextRequest){
    //extract the body
    const body = await req.json();
    await client.user.create({ //agar aisi cheeze dont work, most prolly means await was needed
        data: {
            username: body.username,
            password: body.password
        }
    })
    
    return Response.json({
        message: "User created successfully"
    })
}
