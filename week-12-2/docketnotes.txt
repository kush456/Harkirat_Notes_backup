see iske lecture notes to understand it on a high level 

docker lets you create containers
containers are basically mini computers running on your computer

say you start a node.js application on a container on port 3000
that is on that mini computer's port 3000, so if you do localhost:/3000, wont show anything

so you can run mongo db node postgres etc on these containers withuot having to install them on your device
you do this by using images, images are basicallythe mongo db postgres etc that can be used on containers
think of them as CD a friend gave you that has a game on it downloaded from their pc, so you take that cd and download it yourself from it
you can get these from dockerhub, you pull the image 


Port mapping
basically means if i run or let say connect to a mongo db server using compass on a certain port, it wont work
i can map this port to map to the port of the container where my mongo is running


-e means environment variables
-d means detach mode
-p means port mapping
