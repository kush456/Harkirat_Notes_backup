important things about typescript:
- it is a superset of javascript, javascript but with types, strongly typed javascript
which means any typscript code will run in js, but a js code wont work in ts
- it is a statically typed language, meaning that the types are checked at compile time, not runtime
which means, it is not the language that runs in your browser, node.js or runs at all
it just all the compilation, then if it is good to go, it transpiles down to a javascript file, which then runs 

initializing a typescript project:

npm init -y ( package.json)
then:
npx tsc --init
